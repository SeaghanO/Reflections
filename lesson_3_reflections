Lesson Three Reflections 


Modified this file in Remote repository for lesson three. Gives me a file to pull to local.

This is for lesson on pulling files from git hub

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1- DISASTER RECOVERY 
2- Sharing work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Might not be ready for other peoples changes, e.g. may need to debug my code first.

Lesson 3-7+ 2015-12-27A
Clone: A copy of a repository from GitHub to your local drive. 
Forking is cloning IN GITHUB with notification given to the original that a copy was made. 
Branch offshoot of the current master or other branch that must be committed in order to be 
accessible.

Need to work with GIT FETCH

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Can work on it offline then fetch/merge or pull others changes down L8R.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder ?
Sneaker net or Email- ONLY one person working on a file at a time. Version control would be more difficult.
It might be slower as ONLY one person working on a file at a time.
